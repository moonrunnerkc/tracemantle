"""Capture the CLI's mode-conflict output for every pair of mode flags.

Writes tests/fixtures/mode_conflicts.json: for each unordered pair of mode
flags, the exit code and the exact stderr the CLI produced. The fixture is the
ground truth that tests/test_mode_conflicts.py replays, so the declarative
table in tracemantle.modes has to reproduce the pre-refactor wording byte for
byte rather than merely rejecting the same combinations.

Every pair is run against a path that does not exist. Conflict detection runs
before path resolution, so a conflicting pair exits on its conflict message and
a non-conflicting pair falls through to the same path error. That makes the
capture total: it records which pairs conflict as well as what they say.

Regenerate only when a conflict message is intentionally reworded, and read the
diff. A fixture that moves on its own means the CLI changed under you.
