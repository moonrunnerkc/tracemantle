## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- TraceMantle is the canonical distribution, package and CLI (1.6.0). The old distribution must be uninstalled before installing the renamed package; no `skillcheck` executable is installed. Historical v1 schema identifiers remain unchanged.
- Standard field classification, bounded parsing, report policy and evidence comparison follow the implementation plan. See `docs/implementation-status.md` for executed verification.
- Repository links and integration examples now use `moonrunnerkc/tracemantle`. PyPI publishing uses the trusted GitHub identity and requires the complete CI gate. Cross-platform checkout rules preserve fixture bytes, including the literal CRLF parser control.

The following development notes predate the rename. Old module paths describe that intermediate state; current contracts and verification are recorded in the implementation ledger.

### Added

- Tests for every rejection path in `skillcheck.toml` loading. Unknown keys, wrong value types, and malformed TOML all raised `ConfigError`, but nothing asserted that the message names the offending key, so a misconfiguration meant reading the loader source to find out which key was wrong. Config discovery is covered too: nearest config wins, a file anchor resolves, and the walk stops at a repository root.
- `--explain-score` reports why each dimension scored what it did, not just the number. The breakdown line was five bare figures, which said a dimension lost points but not which phrasing would earn them back, while the aggregate suggestion list did not say which dimension it belonged to. Each component now names its concrete signal: the matched action verb, the matched trigger text and whether it was explicit or contextual, the content-word ratio, the specific vague words penalized, and the length. Text output only; the JSON breakdown shape is unchanged.
- `scripts/score_corpus.py` scores every description in a tree of SKILL.md files and prints the distribution plus per-dimension miss rates, so a scorer change can be measured before and after rather than argued about. Deterministic, no network, no model.
- Golden-file tests for the three warning modes that generate the most user friction: unknown frontmatter fields, reserved-word name collisions, and person-voice descriptions. Each case under `tests/golden/<case>/` is a real SKILL.md plus an `expected.txt` holding the full diagnostic list (rule ID, severity, line, message), diffed whole rather than by substring, so a reworded message, a shifted line, a dropped diagnostic, or a new one all fail the same way. A clean-baseline case acts as the negative control. Regenerate with `make regen-golden-warnings`.
- Golden-file tests for all five report renderers (`text`, `json`, `md`, `agent`, `github`). One fixed diagnostic set covering both outcomes, all three severities, present and absent line numbers and context, and the characters each format escapes is compared byte for byte against `tests/fixtures/golden/`. `formatters.py` is the entire user-facing surface and had only escaping-helper tests; it now measures 97%. Regenerate with `make regen-golden`.
- Direct tests for activation hypothesis generation and its three renderers, which were reachable only through subprocess CLI tests that the coverage tracer cannot see. `core/activation.py` goes from 32% to 96% and `core/activation_render.py` from 32% to 100%.
- README documents measured token estimation error bands, produced by the new `scripts/measure_token_error.py` against a corpus of 61 real SKILL.md files: 23.0% median and 30.7% p95 for a whole file, 25.9% and 35.3% for frontmatter, 22.7% and 30.7% for a body, all three reading high on 61 of 61 files. The bias being one-directional matters for a budget check, since it warns early rather than missing an oversized skill, and the README now says plainly to install the tiktoken extra before trusting a diagnostic near a limit.
- The error figures previously quoted in `tokenizer.py` and repeated in the README were wrong. The comment claimed ~15% average error for the word-run heuristic and ~20% for the `chars / 4` rule it supposedly beat; measured on the corpus the heuristic is 23.0% median and `chars / 4` is 6.3%, so the ordering was backwards. The estimator itself is unchanged, because swapping it would move every token diagnostic and that is not a documentation change; the measurement is recorded so the choice can be made deliberately.

### Changed

- Description scorer tuned against a corpus of 61 installed skills. Two measured defects: six descriptions scored zero on the action dimension purely because `use` was absent from a 170-entry verb list, and twelve scored zero on trigger while not one of the 61 reached the 25-point tier, which needs two pattern matches when the patterns were near-synonyms of a single phrasing. Added the action verbs `add`, `brainstorm`, `bundle`, `choose`, `debug`, `design`, `dispatch`, `finish`, `guide`, `implement`, `package`, `plan`, `receive`, `review`, `solve`, `start`, `use`, `verify`, and `write`, keeping `help`, `support`, and `provide` out because they name no observable action. Added the trigger forms `should be used when`, `when the user asks/wants/needs`, `when asked to`, and the bare temporal clauses `when <verb>ing`, `before <verb>ing`, `after <verb>ing`. Trigger patterns are now scored in two tiers, explicit and contextual, because a single tier gave "A nice helper when using things" the same credit as "Use when receiving code review feedback". Corpus median moved 75 to 90 and mean 76.4 to 90.4; action zero-scores 6/61 to 0/61, trigger zero-scores 12/61 to 5/61 and full credit 0/61 to 43/61. Keyword, specificity, and length scoring are untouched.
- Every user-controlled file goes through one guard, `io_limits.read_guarded_text`, before a parser sees it: size measured with `stat` so an oversized file is never read, then UTF-8 validity, then a control-character policy. Ingest responses, the history ledger, and `skillcheck.toml` are all routed through it. Control characters other than tab, newline, and carriage return are refused, since a NUL or a raw ESC in structured input is either a binary file handed to a text parser or an attempt to smuggle terminal escapes into a diagnostic. C1 code points are deliberately allowed through, being ordinary text that `sanitize_ingested_text` already neutralizes at display.
- Rejection messages name files by a path relative to the working directory, or by bare file name when the file sits outside it, so CI logs no longer publish the build machine's directory layout. A path the user typed on the command line is still echoed verbatim; shortening that would hide which path they got wrong.
- A corrupt ledger under `--show-history` exits 2 instead of 1. The README documents 2 as the code for malformed input, which an unreadable ledger is, so the previous 1 contradicted the documented contract.
- The ingest rejection messages converged on the shared guard's wording, which is the unavoidable consequence of three callers sharing one function. Exit codes are unchanged.
- CLI mode flags, their groups, and every incompatibility are declared once in the new `skillcheck.modes` and the conflict checks are generated from it. The rules were previously spread across four places in `cli.py`: a pairwise table, two hand-written dicts mapping flags to argparse destinations, a multi-emit branch, and a ledger check in `main` outside the conflict function entirely, so adding a mode meant editing all four. Emit-versus-emit, emit-versus-ledger, and ledger-versus-ledger conflicts now follow from the group each flag declares; emit-versus-augment pairs stay listed individually because not every pair is disallowed. `find_mode_conflict` returns the message instead of printing and exiting, so the table is testable in process. No behavior change: all 45 pairs of the ten mode flags were captured from the CLI first (`tests/fixtures/mode_conflicts.json`, regenerated by `scripts/regen_mode_conflict_fixture.py`) and the table reproduces every exit code and every stderr byte for byte, including the 15 pairs that legitimately combine.
- Every file skillcheck reads from disk is bounded by one shared guard in the new `skillcheck.io_limits`. Only ingested agent responses were capped before; the SKILL.md, the `.skillcheck-history.json` ledger, and `skillcheck.toml` were read with a bare `read_text()`. In CI running over a fork's pull request all three arrive from the branch under test, so an oversized one was read fully into memory before any rule ran. Caps are 4 MiB for a SKILL.md, 8 MiB for a ledger, 1 MiB for a config, and the existing 5 MiB for an ingest payload, each measured with `stat` before the read. `enforce_size_cap` takes the caller's exception type, so `ParseError`, `LedgerError`, and `ConfigError` keep their own remediation text.
- The description-score maxima have one home. `score_description` carried the per-dimension weights as literals and `formatters.py` hardcoded a second copy for the `--explain-score` denominators, so changing a weight would have left the report weighing a dimension against a stale cap. Both now read `config.DESCRIPTION_SCORE_WEIGHTS`, and the tests pin the scorer's dimensions to the weight table and assert the weights sum to 100. Rendered output is unchanged.
- Coverage now follows the CLI subprocesses. Most CLI tests shell out to `python -m skillcheck` on purpose, since exit codes and stdout are the contract and only a real process exercises them, but the tracer does not follow a subprocess by default. `cli.py` and `commands.py` therefore measured 34% and 14% while being the most exercised code in the suite. `parallel = true` plus `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` set from `tests/conftest.py` fixes it: `cli.py` 34% to 77%, `commands.py` 14% to 61%, `__main__.py` 0% to 100%, total 82% to 90%.
- Coverage floor raised from 68% to 80% across this cycle, measured at 90.3%. The floor holds even if subprocess tracing fails outright on some platform, which would drop measurement back to roughly 82%.

### Fixed

- A ledger or a `skillcheck.toml` containing non-UTF-8 bytes crashed with an uncaught `UnicodeDecodeError` traceback and exit 1. The config case was the worse of the two: `find_config` discovers `skillcheck.toml` by walking up from the scanned path, so a poisoned file sitting next to a skill broke any scan of that tree with no flag involved. Both now exit 2 with a diagnostic naming the file, the offending byte, and its offset.
- The markdown report said "`1` warnings". The count is now pluralized like the text report.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- `metadata` is recognized as an ecosystem frontmatter field. It previously produced `frontmatter.field.unknown` (warning); it now produces `frontmatter.field.ecosystem` (info), matching `license`, `repository`, `homepage`, and `template`. Thanks to @kriptoburak.

### Changed

- `release.yml` repoints the `v1` moving major tag after a successful publish, in a separate job that holds the only `contents: write` scope in the workflow. Moving it was a manual step in the release checklist and was missed for v1.3.0 and v1.4.1, so `uses: moonrunnerkc/skillcheck@v1` resolved to v1.2.3 source from May 7 until now. Prerelease tags that the `v*.*.*` trigger glob also matches are skipped, and the first release of a new major line creates the tag instead of updating it.
- `release.yml` runs `scripts/check_changelog_release.py` before the build and refuses to publish when the CHANGELOG is in a state `release-notes.yml` cannot promote: a version heading that already exists alongside a non-empty `[Unreleased]`, or no heading and nothing to promote. `release-notes.yml` now fails on the first of those instead of exiting 0 with a message in the log.
- The `--cov-fail-under=68` coverage floor moved out of pytest `addopts`, which applied it to every invocation and failed any single-file run at 0%. Coverage is still measured on a plain `pytest`; the floor is enforced by the new `make test` target, `make verify-release`, and the CI test job.
- Mypy's `files` list takes `scripts` as a directory instead of naming each script, so a new script is type-gated on arrival rather than when someone remembers to add it.
- `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` moved from v1.12.4 (January 2025) to v1.14.2. The publish step installs hatchling unpinned, so the wheel carries whatever `Metadata-Version` the current backend emits; v1.12.4 bundles a twine that rejects the `2.5` hatchling writes today, and it failed the first 1.5.0 publish with "not a valid metadata version". The publisher has to track the build backend, so it is no longer left on an old pin.

### Removed

- The duplicate `SKILL.md` at the repository root. The self-host skill lives at `skills/skillcheck/SKILL.md`, which is what the coherence tests, the self-host suite, the fixture regenerator, and `make verify-release` all read. The root copy was covered by none of them and had drifted to version 1.3.0 with the older description. `tests/test_version_coherence.py` now asserts exactly one tracked `SKILL.md` outside `tests/fixtures`.

### Fixed

- Ten entries that shipped in 1.4.1 are recorded under `[1.4.1]` instead of `[Unreleased]`. The release commit promoted part of the block by hand, `release-notes.yml` treats an existing version heading as already promoted, and the remainder was left behind. The published v1.4.1 release notes omitted the empty-frontmatter fix, the symlink-safe directory walk, per-table body sizing, skill-relative reference paths, the config-loader hardening, the ledger `fsync`, event-stream YAML anchor detection, and the GitHub annotation escaping.
- The `version` input description in `action.yml` gave `1.2.3` as its example, a version with a git tag and a GitHub release but no PyPI artifact, so setting it failed the install the input feeds. It also described an empty value as "latest" when an empty value installs from the action's own checkout.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.mypy]` configuration in `pyproject.toml`. Ruff lints `src` and `tests` with an explicit `E, F, I, UP, B` selection at line length 127 (`E501` ignored for unavoidable long string literals in JSON fixtures and schema text). Mypy runs `strict` against `src/skillcheck` under `python_version = "3.10"`, with an `ignore_missing_imports` override for the untyped `tiktoken` dependency and the `tomllib` 3.11+ stdlib backport branch. The source was brought clean under both with real annotations, not blanket ignores.
- Test coverage measurement via `pytest-cov` (added to the `dev` extra). `[tool.coverage.run]` and `[tool.coverage.report]` configure the run, and `addopts` in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` adds `--cov=skillcheck --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=68`, so the floor is enforced on every local run and in CI (which runs the same `pytest`). The floor sits a few points under the ~72% measured on CPython 3.10 to absorb matrix variance: the CLI modules run in subprocesses the in-process tracer does not see, the `tomllib` vs fallback-parser branch flips between Python 3.10 and 3.11+, and a few tests skip on Windows.
- Added the `Typing :: Typed` classifier so PyPI reflects the shipped `py.typed` marker.

### Changed

- CI `lint` job now enforces `ruff check src tests` and `mypy src/skillcheck` (strict) on every push and pull request, replacing the prior `compileall`-only check. Either tool reporting a finding fails the job.
- `cli.py` split to separate argument wiring from command execution. Parser construction, `skillcheck.toml` application, mode-conflict dispatch, and `main` stay in `cli.py`; the per-mode handlers (emit prompts and graphs, `--show-history`, the default validation pipeline) and the path and ingest IO helpers move to a new `skillcheck.commands` module. `skillcheck.cli:main` and the `skillcheck` console script are unchanged. Pure refactor, no behavior change.
- The published JSON Schemas (`critique-v1.json`, `graph-v1.json`) now set `additionalProperties: false` on every object, matching the parsers, which already reject unknown fields. An agent that validates its output against the schema no longer produces responses that pass the schema but fail ingest.
- Release automation moved to a dedicated tag-triggered `release.yml`. It builds the wheel and sdist, verifies the built version matches the tag, attests build provenance, and publishes to PyPI through trusted publishing. The dead attest step in `ci.yml` (gated on tags but on a workflow that never runs on tags) was removed, so the README's provenance claim is now backed by a workflow that actually runs. `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the one-time PyPI trusted-publishing setup.
- Third-party GitHub Actions are now pinned to full commit SHAs (with a trailing version comment) across all workflows and `action.yml`, replacing floating major-version tags, closing the supply-chain window where a compromised or force-moved tag could run with the workflows' write permissions. The one exception is `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`, which is pinned to a release version tag: it runs a Docker container whose image is published to ghcr.io tagged by version, never by commit SHA, so a SHA ref both fails to resolve and pins nothing (the image is fetched by tag regardless).
- `pre-commit` is now part of the `dev` extra, so the two `test_pre_commit.py` end-to-end hook tests actually run in CI instead of silently skipping.
- `make verify-release` actually builds the sdist and wheel now. The old guard used `command -v python3 -c "import build"`, which only resolved the `python3` path and never tested the `build` module, so the build verification was effectively meaningless. The target also gained a drift grep asserting the README's pre-commit `rev:` matches the pyproject version, and the README `rev:` was corrected from `v1.3.0` to `v1.4.0`.
- Internal refactors, no behavior change: the three copies of frontmatter-block extraction (`_frontmatter_block`, `_extract_frontmatter_raw`, `_extract_frontmatter_text`) are deduplicated to the single `frontmatter_common._frontmatter_block`.
- The critique and graph parsers now share `require_field` and `decode_json_or_raise` from `agents/_ingest.py` instead of each carrying its own copy. As a side effect the critique JSON-decode error message adopts the graph parser's wording (exception type and diagnostic content unchanged).
- Dead code removed: the unused `core/reporter.py` module (the CLI renders through `formatters.py`) and the `merge_critique_diagnostics` shim (identical to `merge_diagnostics`, now called directly). No public CLI or `skillcheck.validate` behavior changes.
- Oversized modules decomposed with no behavior change: the CLI mode-conflict table and checker are hoisted to module level; `run_validation` is split into `_compute_exit_code`, `_record_history`, and `_print_report`; the capability-graph data model moves to `core/graph_model.py`; and the ledger filesystem I/O moves to `core/history_io.py`. All original import paths still resolve via re-exports.
- Quality gates extended to `scripts/`: CI and the `Makefile` now run `ruff check src tests scripts`, and mypy's `files` list includes the checked-in utility scripts so they are type-gated alongside the package. `scripts/summarize_batch.py` was brought clean under both.

### Fixed

- Non-dict frontmatter (a bare scalar or list between the `---` delimiters) no longer crashes with an `AttributeError` traceback. `parser.parse` now raises `ParseError` naming the actual YAML type and the path, which the validation pipeline renders as a clean `parse.error` diagnostic and exit 1.
- Template detection no longer misreads bracketed acronyms as placeholders. The `[...]` branch of the placeholder pattern was unescaped, so `[ISO]`, `[API]`, and `[CLI]` in a real description matched and silently suppressed the deployment-blocking ERROR checks (`frontmatter.name.directory-mismatch`, `compat.vscode-dirname`, description scoring). The literal three-dot placeholder is now matched exactly.
- `--ingest-critique` and `--ingest-graph` now reject a multi-skill target instead of stamping the first skill's ingested diagnostics onto every file. An agent response describes one skill, so pointing an ingest flag at a directory that resolves to more than one SKILL.md exits `2` with an error naming the flag and the path count.
- A malformed history ledger now raises a clean `LedgerError` instead of an uncaught `TypeError`. `load_ledger` validates that the JSON root is an object, that `runs` is a list, and that each run entry is well-formed, and it now checks the `version` field against `LEDGER_SCHEMA_VERSION` (previously read but never enforced), naming both versions on mismatch. Every failure carries the "delete it and re-run with --history" remediation.
- `--analyze-graph` no longer crashes on a repeated tool. `allowed-tools: [Bash, Bash]` minted two graph nodes with the same content-hash ID, tripping the duplicate-node-ID guard with an uncaught `ValueError`. The heuristic extractor now dedupes tool names before building nodes.
- Emit and re-parse modes no longer surface a traceback on a file that plain validation handles cleanly. `--emit-graph`, `--emit-critique-prompt`, `--emit-graph-prompt`, `--agent-reason`, `--activation-hypotheses`, `--analyze-graph`, `--history`, and the `--ingest-*` first-path re-parse now catch `ParseError`, print the message to stderr, and exit 1. `read_ingest_raw` additionally catches `UnicodeDecodeError`, so a non-UTF-8 ingest response file takes the clean exit-2 path instead of crashing.
- Codex compatibility provenance now carries its own `_CODEX_DATA_DATE` constant instead of borrowing `_CLAUDE_DATA_DATE`. The mislabel was invisible because all three provenance dates were equal; the date reported for Codex is now sourced from and freshness-checked against the Codex constant independently.
- Empty frontmatter (`---\n---`) is now recognized instead of leaking the delimiters into the body and its line count.
- Directory scanning uses `os.walk(followlinks=False)` instead of `Path.rglob`, so a directory symlink cannot pull in files from another tree or hang the scan on a symlink cycle.
- `disclosure.body-bloat` sizes each markdown table independently. Previously every `|`-row in the body was summed as one table, so several small tables could report a false oversized-table count.
- Broken-reference and reference-escape diagnostics now show the resolved path relative to the skill directory (`scripts/foo.py`, or `../..` for an escape) instead of the absolute host path, so CI logs no longer leak the build machine's directory layout.
- Corrected the `estimate_tokens` docstring: tiktoken downloads its vocabulary on first use, so it is not "fully offline" until the cache is warm; the whitespace fallback is always offline.
- `skillcheck.toml` handling improved: config type errors now name the offending value; the Python 3.10 fallback parser no longer truncates a value at a `#` inside quotes; `find_config` stops ascending at a `.git` repository root or the user's home instead of walking to the filesystem root; and the CLI prints which config file it loaded (to stderr) when one is found.
- History ledger writes are more durable: `save_ledger` now flushes and `fsync`s the temp file before the atomic `os.replace`, and `load_ledger` sweeps stale `.skillcheck-tmp-*` files left behind by an interrupted write. The module documents its single-writer assumption (no file locking).
- `frontmatter.yaml-anchors` no longer false-positives on `&` or `*` inside quoted string values. A description like `"Reviews R&D notes and *only* flags risky items"` used to match the anchor/alias regexes; detection now walks the YAML event stream, so only real anchors and aliases are reported.
- `--format github` no longer over-escapes diagnostic message text. Message data now escapes only `%`, CR, and LF (per the GitHub Actions toolkit), so a colon or comma in a message renders literally instead of as `%3A`/`%2C`. Property values (`file`, `title`) still escape `:` and `,` as required, which also fixes the previously unescaped colon in the annotation title.

### Security

- `action.yml` no longer interpolates user-controlled inputs into the shell script. Every input is passed through an `env:` mapping and referenced as `"$INPUT_*"`, so a crafted input value cannot break out of the `run:` block and execute arbitrary commands. Behavior is otherwise identical.
- Ingested critique and graph responses are treated as untrusted input: strings taken from them (missing-context items, contradiction locations, findings, and graph node names) are stripped of terminal control characters before they reach the human-readable report. A response carrying raw ANSI escapes can no longer forge terminal output (a fake `PASS` line, a cleared screen). Control characters are rendered in a visible backslash-escaped form rather than dropped. The JSON output path is unchanged (`json.dumps` already escapes control characters).
- Ingested responses are size-bounded. A response file or stdin payload over 5 MiB (`MAX_INGEST_BYTES`) is rejected with exit 2 before it is read into memory, and any single response list (findings, missing_context, contradictions, capabilities, inputs, outputs, edges) over 10,000 items (`MAX_INGEST_LIST_ITEMS`) is rejected with a clear error. Both messages name the actual size/count and the cap.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- README exit-codes table expanded: the `1` row now lists every escalation path (errors, warning-only run with `--strict`, regression with `--fail-on-regression`, ingest parse failure) and includes the `1` > `3` priority note that was previously only in `.github/CLAUDE.md`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents platform-skipped tests so the next maintainer knows why pass/skip ratios differ across the CI matrix without having to grep the suite.
- CLI mutual-exclusion block refactored to a single `_PAIRWISE_CONFLICTS` table walked by one loop, replacing nine hand-written `if ... and ...:` branches. Exit code 2 and stderr messages are unchanged.
- `--history` now fans out across every target path instead of silently writing only when exactly one path is supplied. Each SKILL.md still gets its own per-skill `.skillcheck-history.json` next to it. `--fail-on-regression` escalates to exit 1 when any target regresses.
- `--show-history` with multiple paths still reads only the first path's ledger (each skill has its own), but the extra paths now produce a stderr warning instead of being silently dropped.
- README Configuration section now documents that `--ignore PREFIX` accepts any dotted rule prefix, not just top-level categories. The worked example shows `--ignore compat.unverified` so users can silence the unverified-field info diagnostics while keeping `compat.claude-only` and `compat.vscode-dirname`.
- `action.yml` install step now prefers the action's own checkout when `inputs.version` is empty and `pyproject.toml` is present at `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`. This pins both `uses: moonrunnerkc/skillcheck@<tag>` and `uses: ./` dogfood jobs to the tag's source, closing the previous PyPI/tag drift window. When `inputs.version` is set, the action still installs from PyPI at that pin. The PyPI range install remains as a fallback for environments where the checkout is absent.
- `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` now passes `--no-color` by default. The captured pre-commit log is plain text instead of carrying ANSI escapes from a TTY-less invocation. Consumers who want color back can override `args:` in their own `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Added

- Build provenance attestations on tagged releases. The CI `package` job now invokes `actions/attest-build-provenance@v1` against the built wheel and sdist when the ref starts with `refs/tags/v`. Consumers can verify with `gh attestation verify dist/skillcheck-*.whl --owner moonrunnerkc` before installing. Documented in the README's new `## Releases` section.
- `.github/workflows/release-notes.yml`: when a GitHub Release is published, the workflow inspects `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` block and, if it has un-promoted content for the tag, opens a PR against `main` that moves the block under a `[<tag>] - <today>` heading. No-op when `[Unreleased]` is empty or when the developer already promoted by hand.
- `tests/test_agent_prompts_smoke.py`: snapshot tests that pin SHA-256 digests of each rendered prompt (six combinations: critique/graph x claude/codex/cursor) against `tests/fixtures/valid_basic.md`. Catches accidental edits to prompt scaffolding without requiring an oracle for prompt quality.
- Published JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) files for the agent IO contracts: `src/skillcheck/schemas/critique-v1.json` and `src/skillcheck/schemas/graph-v1.json`. Both ship with the wheel. `skillcheck.agents.SCHEMAS` maps `"critique-v1"` and `"graph-v1"` to the on-disk paths so callers can validate agent responses before invoking `--ingest-critique` or `--ingest-graph`. The schemas mirror the parser-enforced required fields, severity enum, kind enums, and score ranges; `test_published_schemas.py` guards drift between the schema files and the parsers.
- `[frontmatter] reserved_words` config key in `skillcheck.toml`. Replaces the default `('anthropic', 'claude')` reserved-word list that powers `frontmatter.name.reserved-word`. An empty array reverts to the defaults so orgs cannot silently disable the check. Example: `reserved_words = ["acme", "internal"]`.
- `references.broken-link` and `references.depth-exceeded` now also scan HTML anchor tags (`<a href="...">`) and inline backtick spans that contain a directory separator (e.g. `` `scripts/foo.py` ``). The backtick extractor is shared with the capability graph (`skillcheck.core.extract_backtick_refs`) so the two extractors agree on what counts as a path-like token. Fenced code blocks (```` ``` ```` blocks) are stripped before backtick scanning so command samples do not produce false positives, and bare filenames (`report.json` with no directory) are excluded because they are typically output mentions, not references.
- `_VAGUE_WORDS` now includes `seamless` and `empowering`. Both lack a concrete-attribute reading in SKILL.md description context and appear on the project's own AI-tell ban list (`.github/CLAUDE.md`). `robust` and `comprehensive` remain excluded because they can describe concrete attributes when qualified (per the v1.1.0 rubric decision).

### Fixed

- `tokenizer._get_tiktoken_enc` is now thread-safe. The first-init fast path takes a module-level lock and re-checks the cached state, so concurrent callers (e.g. editor plugins running in a worker pool) cannot race on `tiktoken.get_encoding`.
- `_is_action_verb` now recognizes `-ing` and `-ed` inflections, including the e-drop ("validating" -> "validate") and doubled-consonant ("scanning" -> "scan") forms. Descriptions like "Validating skills..." or "Used for..." used to score 0 on the action axis even though the leading word was a clear action verb.
- `--format` error message now lists `github` as a valid choice (`cli.py`). The argparse `choices=` set on the `--format` definition has accepted `github` since v1.2.3, but the post-parse runtime check still printed the pre-v1.2.3 four-value list.

### Removed

- Empty `action/` directory and the stale `compileall ... action` step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The Python entrypoint was deleted in v1.3.0; the empty directory and its CI reference lingered. No shipped behavior change (the compile step was already a no-op against an empty directory).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- `--strict` umbrella flag. Escalates warning-only runs to exit 1 and turns on `--strict-vscode` and `--strict-cursor`. Reserves the `strict-all` config field for future strict rules to opt into automatically.
- `strict` action input (`action.yml`).
- TOML config: `strict-all = true` is now accepted in `skillcheck.toml`.
- `--explain-score` flag. Shows per-dimension breakdown (action, trigger, keywords, specificity, length) under each `description.quality-score` diagnostic in text output. JSON format always includes the `breakdown` object regardless of the flag.
- `--fail-on-regression` flag. With `--history`, promotes `history.skill.regressed` to exit 1. Independent of `--strict`.
- `fail-on-regression` and `explain-score` action inputs in `action.yml`.
- Provenance dates on cross-agent diagnostics. Every `compat.*` rule that encodes platform-specific behavior now includes `(as of YYYY-MM-DD)`.
- `_CLAUDE_DATA_DATE`, `_VSCODE_DATA_DATE`, `_CURSOR_DATA_DATE` constants in `rules/compat.py`.
- `test_compat_data_freshness.py`: staleness tests asserting each date is within 365 days of today.
- `tiktoken` action input in `action.yml`. Set `tiktoken: true` to install `skillcheck[tiktoken]`.
- `score_description()` now returns a 3-tuple `(score, suggestions, breakdown)` with per-dimension point breakdown.

### Changed

- Mutual-exclusion block in CLI refactored: individual print-and-sys.exit(2) pairs replaced by `_EMIT_MODES`/`_AUGMENT_FLAGS` dicts and a single `_die_on_mode_conflict()` resolver. Net LOC reduced; behavior identical.
- `--semantic` flag help string now states that it implies `--analyze-graph` when no `--ingest-graph` is supplied.
- `action.yml` install line tightened from unpinned `skillcheck` to `skillcheck>=1.2,<2`. Python version pinned to `3.12` for the setup-python step.
- README options table: removed `--warnings-as-errors` row; added `--fail-on-regression` and `--explain-score` rows.
- README exit codes section: `--strict` and `--fail-on-regression` are now the only documented warning-escalation knobs.
- README GitHub Action section: added `tiktoken: true` documentation.
- Compat diagnostic messages updated with `(as of YYYY-MM-DD)` provenance suffixes.

### Removed

- `--warnings-as-errors` flag (replaced by `--strict`, which subsumes the same exit-code escalation).
- `action/entrypoint.py` (unused since v1.2.3; the composite action runs skillcheck directly).
- `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.1.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md` (CHANGELOG.md is the canonical history).

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- `--format github`: outputs diagnostics as GitHub Actions workflow commands (`::error`, `::warning`, `::notice`) with proper escaping for file, line, and message properties. The GitHub Action now defaults to this format so PR annotations render automatically without a Python entrypoint.
- `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`: adds a `skillcheck` hook for pre-commit, matching `SKILL.md` files and passing filenames to the CLI.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: documents the release convention (immutable patch tags plus a force-updated `v1` moving major tag).
- `tests/__init__.py`: makes the test package importable, fixing `from tests.conftest` in environments where another `tests` package shadows the path.
- `nargs="+"` on the `path` argument: the CLI now accepts multiple paths (required by pre-commit's `pass_filenames` mode). Single-path usage is unchanged.

### Changed

- `action.yml` simplified to a two-step composite action that installs skillcheck via pip and runs it directly. The Python entrypoint (`action/entrypoint.py`) is no longer invoked; `--format github` handles PR annotations natively. The `format` input defaults to `github` (was `json`, which was ignored at runtime).
- README GitHub Action section updated to reflect automatic PR annotations via `--format github`.
- README pre-commit section added with a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` snippet.
- README test count updated to 701.

### Removed

- The Python entrypoint (`action/entrypoint.py`) for annotation parsing and step summary generation is no longer used by the action. The action runs skillcheck directly.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- `compat.cursor-description-block-scalar` rule (INFO by default). Flags `description: >`, `description: >+`, `description: |`, and `description: |+` because Cursor's skills UI renders these as empty. The Cursor-safe form is `description: >-` (folded strip). Closes #1.
- `--strict-cursor` flag promotes the new rule to ERROR and fails the run. Mirrors `--strict-vscode`.
- `cursor` is now a valid `--target-agent` choice; promotes the rule to WARNING when set without `--strict-cursor`.
- `strict-cursor` action input (`action.yml`) and `INPUT_STRICT_CURSOR` wiring (`action/entrypoint.py`).
- TOML config: `strict-cursor = true` is now accepted in `skillcheck.toml`.

### Changed

- `frontmatter.name.required` and `frontmatter.description.required` now append a hint when the missing field appears as a `## name:` or `## description:` markdown heading inside the frontmatter block. Frontmatter keys are YAML, not markdown; the hint nudges authors to drop the `##` prefix. Closes #1.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- `description.quality-score` no longer flags verb-led descriptions starting with `investigate`, `diagnose`, `triage`, `troubleshoot`, `examine`, `audit`, `inspect`, `compare`, `capture`, `normalize`, or `refactor`. Expanded `_ACTION_VERBS` from 43 to 170 entries to cover investigation, inspection, search, code-work, output, comparison, logging, and normalization clusters. Closes #2.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-29

Backward compatibility: previously-passing skills still pass. Some previously-failing skills now warn instead of error and produce exit code 0 instead of 1.

### Added

- `template.detected` info-level rule and `src/skillcheck/template_detection.py` module.
- `ECOSYSTEM_FIELDS` classification for `license`, `repository`, `homepage`, and `template`.
- Config support for `[frontmatter] extension_fields` in `skillcheck.toml`.

### Changed

- `frontmatter.name.reserved-word` demoted from ERROR to WARNING; source tag changed from `spec` to `advisory`; message rewritten.
- `frontmatter.description.person-voice` demoted from ERROR to WARNING; messages rewritten to acknowledge the heuristic.
- Budget-message phrasing aligned with the spec's "recommended" language across `sizing.*` and `disclosure.*` rules.

### Fixed

- `frontmatter.field.unknown` no longer fires on `license`, `repository`, `homepage`, or `template`; these now produce info-level `frontmatter.field.ecosystem` diagnostics or are silent for user extensions.
- Templates (placeholder content, `template: true` flag, or files under `template/` or `templates/` directories) no longer trigger deployment-blocking checks (`frontmatter.name.directory-mismatch`, `compat.vscode-dirname`, `description.quality-score`).

### Internal

- Renamed `config.KNOWN_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` to `config.SPEC_FIELDS`.
- New `template.detected` rule wired into `rules/__init__.py`.
- Frontmatter rule implementation split into smaller modules while preserving `skillcheck.rules.frontmatter` imports.
- Root `SKILL.md` restored so `skillcheck SKILL.md` self-validation works from the repository root.
- New fixture set under `tests/fixtures/` covering ecosystem fields, user extensions, template detection, and demoted severities.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-28

External audit against v1.0.1 surfaced eight repo defects ranging from documentation drift to a CI-confusing exit-code conflation. v1.1.0 ships fixes for all eight, reverses one v1.0.1 behavior change that turned out wrong, and tightens the description scorer's vague-word rubric. The minor bump is driven by the exit-code semantics change (now distinguishes warning-only from input error) and the new `--warnings-as-errors` flag.

### Behavior change

- Warning-only CLI reports now return exit code 0 by default, reversing v1.0.1's "warnings exit 2" decision. Exit code 2 is now reserved for tool-misuse / input errors (missing path, conflicting flags, empty directory) so CI consumers can distinguish them. Pass `--warnings-as-errors` to escalate warning-only runs to exit code 1 for stricter gates. Errors remain 1; semantic drift remains 3.

### Added

- `--warnings-as-errors` flag: escalate warning-only runs to exit 1 for CI configurations that want warnings to block.
- `scripts/summarize_batch.py` and `tests/test_batch15_summarize.py`: maintainer-facing tool that consumes a directory of skillcheck batch-run artifacts (one directory per repo, one subdirectory per skill, paired `*.json` / `*.txt` reports per phase) and writes `summary.csv` plus `findings.md`. Invoked as `python scripts/summarize_batch.py <batch_dir>`. Not exposed as a console script, not wired into the GitHub Action; the action runs skillcheck against one path, this consumes outputs across many. Documented under Maintainer Notes in the README.
- `tests/test_readme_test_count_claim.py`: parses the README's "N tests cover ..." sentence and asserts it matches `pytest --collect-only`. The next time the suite grows without bumping the README number, CI fails. Closes the recurring drift pattern that v1.0.1 had to correct twice.

### Changed

- `action.yml` install step pins `skillcheck>=1.0.1` so consumers fail loudly on unpublished v1 features instead of silently running v0.2.0.
- Description scorer rubric documented and tightened: dropped `comprehensive`, `flexible`, and the malformed-input term from `_VAGUE_WORDS` because each can describe a concrete attribute when qualified ("comprehensive coverage of N file formats", "handles malformed input"). The inclusion rubric is now documented inline. Verified against `anthropics/skills` (17 SKILL.md files): zero score changes, because none of those skills use the dropped words. The rubric edit is a no-op against the current corpus; the new regression tests are forward-looking guards against scoring drift if the list is ever re-expanded.
- Description scorer verb matching: collapsed `_ACTION_VERBS` from 86 entries (base + 3rd-person duplicates) to 42 base forms. Added `_is_action_verb()` to handle stem normalization across `-s`, `-es`, and `-ies` endings. Adding a new verb now only requires the base form.
- README test count bumped from 663 to 667 to include the drift-guard test, two description-scorer regression tests, and the `--warnings-as-errors` test.
- README field-test citations: replaced seven gitignored `runs/...` path references with the exact `skillcheck` commands needed to reproduce each finding. Readers can now verify the claims without access to private artifacts.
- README exit-code table reflects the new semantics; flag table documents `--warnings-as-errors`.

### Removed

- Top-level `git-commit-crafter` SKILL.md from the repo root. It was unrelated to skillcheck and confused first-time readers; the canonical example lives at `skills/skillcheck/SKILL.md`.
- False `@v0` tag claim from the README. Only `@v0.2.0` was ever pushed; the action-install snippet no longer suggests a tag that does not exist. CHANGELOG entries that referenced `@v0` corrected to `@v0.2.0`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-28

End-to-end verification against `anthropics/skills` surfaced documentation drift in the published v1.0.0 README and a batch of post-tag implementation work that had not been committed. v1.0.1 commits that work, ships the docs corrections, and adds guide-parity flags. Behavior change: warning-only runs now return exit code 2 (was 0).

### Changed
- Warning-only CLI reports now return exit code 2. Exit code 1 remains errors; exit code 3 remains semantic drift. README Exit Codes table row 0 updated to "no errors and no warnings".
- README test count corrected from 653 to 663.
- README JSON-stability promise updated from "0.x series" to "v1.x series".
- README field-test numbers reframed as April 2026 snapshots against `anthropics/skills`, with a note that they will drift as upstream evolves.
- `action.yml` `format` input description clarified: accepted but ignored at runtime; the action always invokes skillcheck with `--format json`.
- Development extras now include `ruff>=0.6`, `mypy>=1.10`, and `types-PyYAML>=6.0`.

### Added
- `--semantic`: guide-compatible shortcut that enables semantic-adjacent validation. In standalone mode it runs heuristic graph analysis; with ingested agent responses it merges those diagnostics.
- `--agent-reason`: guide-compatible agent-workflow shortcut. Emits a combined critique and graph prompt packet so the calling agent can run both reasoning steps and feed JSON back through `--ingest-critique` and `--ingest-graph`.
- `--format md` and `--format agent`: Markdown report output and agent-oriented next-action output.
- `skillcheck.toml` config loading: top-level defaults for format, thresholds, target agent, strict VS Code mode, skip flags, ignored rule prefixes, graph analysis, semantic mode, history, and agent variants.
- Experimental `--activation-hypotheses`: generates likely natural-language routing triggers plus a discoverability entropy score. Routing caveat included in every report.
- Machine-readable diagnostic metadata: JSON diagnostics now include `source` and `confidence` fields.
- GitHub Action inputs for the v1.0 modes: `semantic`, `analyze-graph`, `ingest-critique`, `critique-agent`, `ingest-graph`, `graph-agent`, `history`, `activation-hypotheses`. The action still always emits JSON internally for PR annotations.
- `tests/test_v1_completion.py`: covers `--format md`, `--format agent`, `--agent-reason`, `--semantic` graph enabling, `--activation-hypotheses` JSON, `skillcheck.toml` loading, and source/confidence in JSON output.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Rewrote README end-to-end for v1.0 launch audience. New sections: "Why This Exists", "Modes" (five subsections: Symbolic, Heuristic Graph, Agent Critique, Agent Graph, History), "Maintainer Notes". Removed v0.2.0-era feature bullet list and duplicated section prose. Restructured Quick Start to lead with the agent-native workflow. Rebuilt Options table from live `argparse` audit; every flag matches its actual help text and default. Rebuilt Rules table from live rule module audit; added source-tag legend paragraph. Added inline v1.0 case study paragraph (full detail at `docs/case-study-v1-real-world-runs.md`). All cited diagnostics and output excerpts trace verbatim to field-test artifacts in `runs/`.
- Added `docs/case-study-v1-real-world-runs.md`: full breakdown of the pre-3B field test covering 18 Anthropic skills (symbolic), `mcp-builder` through the full v1.0 pipeline (symbolic + heuristic graph + agent critique + agent graph), and 5 uxuiprinciples skills (strict VS Code mode). Documents three `semantic.contradiction.detected` errors on a skill that passed all symbolic checks, five `graph.capability.orphaned` patterns, and the recurring unknown-field pattern (`license`, `homepage`, `env`) across official catalogs.

### Added
- Release prep artifacts: `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md`, `LAUNCH_POST_v1.0.md`, `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`.
- `skills/skillcheck/SKILL.md`: skillcheck's own SKILL.md, validating the tool against itself. Passes symbolic, graph, critique, and history validation with zero errors and zero warnings. Serves as the worked example for the Rules table in the README.
- Self-host integration test suite (`tests/test_self_host.py`): confirms the bundled SKILL.md passes symbolic validation, all five graph analyzers, critique ingestion, agent graph ingestion with divergence analysis, full CLI pipeline, history round-trip, and description scoring threshold.
- `scripts/regen_self_host_fixtures.py`: regenerates `tests/fixtures/self_host/graph_clean.json` from the live heuristic graph after skill edits.
- `Makefile` with `regen-self-host-fixtures` target: runs the regen script against `skills/skillcheck/SKILL.md`.
- `--history` flag: appends a validation record to the per-skill `.skillcheck-history.json` ledger next to the SKILL.md file. Off by default; existing invocations see no behavior change. Incompatible with emit modes.
- `--show-history` flag: reads the per-skill ledger and prints it (text or JSON via `--format`), then exits 0. Skips all validation. Incompatible with emit modes and `--history`.
- `history.skill.regressed` WARNING rule: fires when `--history` is active, the skill content hash matches a prior passing run, and the current run fails. Indicates a rule tightened or an agent surfaced a new finding.
- `history.write.failed` WARNING rule: fires when `--history` is active but the ledger file cannot be written. Validation exit code is unaffected.
- `history.read.failed` WARNING rule: fires when `--history` is active but the existing ledger cannot be read. Validation continues without regression check.
- `--emit-graph`: emit mode. Prints the extracted capability graph (text or JSON) to stdout and exits 0. Identifies `Capability`, `Input`, and `Output` nodes plus `requires`/`produces` edges heuristically from heading structure and backtick references. Mutually exclusive with `--analyze-graph`, `--emit-critique-prompt`, and `--ingest-critique`.
- `--analyze-graph`: augment mode. Extracts the capability graph from each file, runs all five graph analyzers, and merges diagnostics into the validation report. Compatible with `--ingest-critique` (both run; results merged per file). Graph WARNINGs do not fail validation or change the exit code.
- Five graph rule checkers (all WARNING severity): `graph.capability.orphaned`, `graph.input.unused`, `graph.output.unproduced`, `graph.capability.empty_description`, `graph.tool.unreferenced`. No double-firing: body inputs and frontmatter tools are handled by separate analyzers.
- `graph_render` module: `render_graph_text` and `render_graph_json` pure rendering functions. JSON output is deterministic (field order follows dataclass declaration).
- `merge_diagnostics` public function in `core.semantic` and `core.__init__`. `merge_critique_diagnostics` is now a thin wrapper; existing callers unchanged.
- `--critique-agent {claude,codex,cursor}`: select the prompt template variant for agent self-critique. Prompt framing is tuned per vendor; the schema, parser, and exit codes are identical across all agents. Requires `--emit-critique-prompt` or `--ingest-critique`. Records the agent name as `critique_source` in JSON output and as a header line in text output. Default: `claude`.
- `--emit-critique-prompt`: print the agent self-critique prompt to stdout and exit 0. Use `--format json` to wrap in `{"prompt": "..."}`. In directory mode, prompts are separated by a delimiter line so downstream tools can split per-skill.
- `--ingest-critique PATH`: read an agent self-critique JSON response from PATH (use `-` for stdin), convert to diagnostics, merge with symbolic results, and emit a unified report.
- Exit code 3: symbolic validation passed but the ingested critique contains semantic errors (contradictions or findings with ERROR severity). Exit code 1 takes priority when symbolic errors exist.
- `--emit-graph-prompt`: print the capability graph extraction prompt to stdout and exit 0. Use `--graph-agent` to select the vendor variant. In directory mode, prompts are separated by the same per-skill delimiter used by `--emit-critique-prompt`.
- `--ingest-graph PATH`: read an agent graph extraction JSON response from PATH (use `-` for stdin), parse it into a `CapabilityGraph` with `source="agent"`, run standard graph analyzers, run divergence analyzers against the heuristic baseline, and merge all diagnostics into the validation report.
- `--graph-agent {claude,codex,cursor}`: select the prompt template variant for graph extraction. Framing is tuned per vendor; the schema, parser, and exit codes are identical across all agents. Requires `--emit-graph-prompt` or `--ingest-graph`. Default: `claude`. Records the agent name as `graph_source` in JSON output and as a header line in text output.
- `graph.contradiction.heuristic_disagreement` (ERROR, source: `agent`): fires when an ingested agent graph claims an edge between two nodes that both appear in the heuristic graph but that edge is absent heuristically. Indicates a possible over-claimed capability. Only active when `--ingest-graph` is used.
- Graph extraction prompt module (`agents.graph_base`, `agents.graph_claude`, `agents.graph_codex`, `agents.graph_cursor`): parallel to the critique prompt module. Claude variant uses XML tags and a full worked example; Codex uses markdown headers and a full worked example; Cursor uses a compact type signature only.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **GitHub Action**: composite action (`moonrunnerkc/skillcheck@v0.2.0`) with PR annotations, job summary table, and JSON output. All CLI flags exposed as action inputs. Three lines of YAML to add to any CI pipeline.
- **`__main__.py` entry point**: `python -m skillcheck` now works as an alternative to the console script.
- **File reference validation**: parses markdown body for `[text](path)`, `![alt](path)`, and `source:`/`file:`/`include:` directives; verifies referenced files exist on disk; warns when references exceed one directory level from SKILL.md.
- **Progressive disclosure budget**: three-tier token budgeting: metadata/frontmatter at ~100 tokens, body at <5,000 tokens, resources loaded on demand. Flags oversized code blocks (>50 lines), large tables (>20 rows), and embedded base64.
- **Cross-agent compatibility warnings**: flags Claude Code-only fields (`model`, `disable-model-invocation`, `mode`, `hooks`, `agent`, `skills`), notes VS Code directory-name requirements, marks fields with unverified behavior in Codex and Cursor. Full compatibility matrix across four agents.
- **Description quality scoring**: scores 0-100 across action verbs, trigger phrases, keyword density, specificity, and length. `--min-desc-score N` flag to enforce a minimum threshold.
- **VS Code strict mode**: `--strict-vscode` promotes VS Code compatibility issues from INFO to ERROR.
- **Agent-scoped checks**: `--target-agent {claude,vscode,all}` scopes compatibility diagnostics to a specific agent.
- **Skip flags**: `--skip-dirname-check` and `--skip-ref-check` for CI environments where filesystem context is unavailable.
- **`-q`/`--quiet` flag**: suppresses all output; exit code only.
- **YAML type coercion detection**: `frontmatter.name.type` and `frontmatter.description.type` catch when `yaml.safe_load` silently converts bare values like `true`, `123`, or `null` into non-string types. Provides clear fix advice (quote the value).
- **YAML anchor detection**: `frontmatter.yaml-anchors` warns when YAML anchors/aliases silently copy values in frontmatter.
- **Symlink escape detection**: `references.escape` errors when a file reference resolves outside the skill directory (CWE-59).
- **GitHub Actions CI workflow**: test matrix across Python 3.10-3.13 on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows; compile check; package build verification.
- **PEP 561 `py.typed` marker**: enables downstream type-checking for library consumers.
- **[Case study](docs/case-study-silent-skill-failure.md)**: documented the silent VS Code skill failure caused by name/directory mismatch.
- This changelog.

### Changed
- `KNOWN_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` expanded to include `model`, `context`, `agent`, `hooks`, `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, `skills`, `mode`, `tags`, `version`, `author`.
- Token estimation uses a word-run + punctuation-run heuristic (~15% error) with optional `tiktoken` for ~5% error.
- Standardized on `collections.abc.Callable` across all modules (was `typing.Callable` in some).

### Fixed
- `check_reference_depth` emitted duplicate diagnostics for `../../` paths (both depth-exceeded and traverses-above). Changed to `elif` so only the most specific warning fires.
- README Rules table described sizing rules as "Body exceeds..." but the code counts full file lines/tokens. Table now says "File exceeds...".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Initial release.
- Frontmatter validation: required fields (`name`, `description`), character constraints, length limits, reserved words, first/second-person voice detection, XML tag rejection, unknown field warnings.
- Name spec compliance: leading/trailing hyphen checks, consecutive hyphen checks, directory-name matching.
- Body sizing: configurable line-count and token-count thresholds.
- CLI with `--format json`, `--max-lines`, `--max-tokens`, `--ignore PREFIX`, `--no-color`, `--version`.
- Deterministic exit codes: 0 (pass), 1 (fail), 2 (input error).
- 137 tests covering all rules and initial CLI behavior.
