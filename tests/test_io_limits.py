"""Every file tracemantle reads from disk is bounded by one shared guard.

Only the ingest path was capped before: `--ingest-critique` checked its payload
against MAX_INGEST_BYTES while the SKILL.md, the history ledger, and
skillcheck.toml were read with a bare `path.read_text()`. In the case that
matters, CI running tracemantle over a fork's pull request, all three arrive
from the branch under test, so an oversized one was read fully into memory
before any rule ran.

These tests write real oversized files rather than mocking `stat`, because the
guard's whole job is to measure what is actually on disk.
