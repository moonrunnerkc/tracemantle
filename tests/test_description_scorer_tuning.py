"""Patterns added to the description scorer after measuring a real corpus.

Every case here is shaped like a description someone actually shipped, taken
from or modeled on a corpus of 61 installed skills, because the defects being
fixed were invisible to invented examples. Two measurements drove the change:

- Six descriptions scored zero on the action dimension purely because "use" was
  missing from a 170-entry verb list, and "Use when receiving code review
  feedback" is the house style for a whole family of real skills.
- Twelve scored zero on trigger, and not one of the 61 reached the 25-point
  tier. That tier needs two pattern matches and the patterns were near-synonyms
  of a single phrasing, so full credit was unreachable rather than merely rare.

Each added pattern gets a positive case (real phrasing that should now score)
and a negative case (prose that must not earn the same credit). The negatives
matter more: the first attempt at this fixed the false negatives and introduced
false positives, where "A nice helper when using things" scored the same trigger
credit as an explicit "Use when ..." because both contain a gerund after a
preposition.
