"""Golden-file tests for the five report renderers.

formatters.py is the whole user-facing surface of tracemantle: it is what CI
logs show, what `--format json` consumers parse, and what GitHub renders as PR
annotations. It had almost no direct coverage. The existing formatter tests
check individual escaping helpers (`test_format_github.py`), which catches a
broken `_escape_data` but not a renderer that drops the context line, reorders
a JSON key, or loses the summary.

One fixed diagnostic set is rendered through every formatter and compared byte
for byte against a checked-in golden file. The set is built to exercise what
the renderers actually branch on: a passing and a failing file, all three
severities, a diagnostic with and without a line number, one with and one
without context, a message containing the characters each format has to escape
(`|` for markdown, `%`/CR/LF for GitHub data, `:` and `,` for GitHub
properties), and a score breakdown so the --explain-score path renders.

Regenerate with `make regen-golden` after an intentional renderer change, and
read the diff before committing it: a golden file that changes without a
matching change in formatters.py means something upstream moved.
