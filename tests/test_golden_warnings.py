"""Golden output for the warning modes that generate the most user friction.

Unknown frontmatter fields, reserved-word name collisions, and person-voice
descriptions are the three findings authors most often argue with, so their
exact wording matters more than most. The case study records the same three as
the commonest real-world failures.

Each case is a real SKILL.md under `tests/golden/<case>/` plus an `expected.txt`
holding the full diagnostic list: rule ID, severity, line, and message, one per
line. The runner diffs actual against expected rather than asserting substrings,
so a reworded message, a shifted line number, a dropped diagnostic, or a new one
appearing all fail the same way.

The point is to freeze current behavior ahead of the scorer work: a change that
improves scoring must not quietly move an unrelated diagnostic, and if it does
move one the diff says exactly which.

Regenerate with `make regen-golden-warnings`, and read the diff.
