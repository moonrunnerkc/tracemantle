    Most CLI tests shell out to ``python -m tracemantle`` on purpose: exit codes
    and stdout are the contract, and only a real process exercises them. The
    tracer does not follow a subprocess by default, so cli.py and commands.py
    measured near zero despite being the most exercised code in the suite.

    Coverage ships a .pth hook that calls ``coverage.process_startup()`` when
    COVERAGE_PROCESS_START is set, so pointing it at pyproject.toml is enough
    for the child to start measuring before it imports tracemantle. Combining the
    per-process data files is pytest-cov's job, given ``parallel = true``.

    Skipped when the run has no coverage active (``--no-cov``), where starting
    coverage in every subprocess would be pure overhead.
