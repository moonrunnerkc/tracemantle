"""Direct coverage for is_template placeholder pattern matching.

The `[...]` branch of the bracketed-placeholder pattern was unescaped, so the
three dots matched any three characters. Bracketed acronyms like [ISO], [API],
and [CLI] in a real skill's description were misread as placeholders, which
silently suppressed deployment-blocking ERROR checks (directory-name match,
VS Code dirname, description scoring).
