"""Description quality scoring for SKILL.md discoverability.

Scores the description field 0-100 across five dimensions:
- Action verb presence (does the description lead with a verb?)
- Trigger phrase detection (does it say when to activate?)
- Keyword density (specific terms vs. generic filler)
- Specificity (avoids vague words without qualifiers)
- Length adequacy (not too short, not too long)

This is the high-value feature no other tool provides. Agents use descriptions
to decide whether to activate a skill. A low score means the skill is invisible.

# the false negatives but created false positives: "A nice helper when using
# things" earned the same trigger credit as "Use when receiving code review
# feedback" because both contain a gerund after a preposition. Weighting the
# tiers separately keeps the real openers at full credit and leaves incidental
