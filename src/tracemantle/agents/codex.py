"""Codex-specific self-critique prompt.

Framing basis: OpenAI's prompt engineering guidance favors concise, direct
system prompts with minimal structural markup. Codex (and GPT-4-class models
in API contexts) respond well to markdown-style section headers and a single
explicit output instruction at the end of the prompt. Verbose XML tagging
adds token cost without measurable accuracy improvement for these models.

Differences from the Claude variant:
- No XML tags. Section boundaries are markdown headers (### Skill, ### Schema).
- Full worked example included but compact (one JSON block, same object as
  the claude variant -- not shortened -- because example fidelity matters more
  than token savings for Codex; cursor handles compression).
- Single "Output only the JSON object." line at the end instead of bracketing.
