"""Base class and shared utilities for agent graph-extraction prompt templates.

Parallel to agents/base.py (critique prompts). Agent subclasses for graph
extraction call these shared helpers directly so schema descriptions and worked
examples stay in sync across prompt variants.

Prompt variants are based on vendor guidance and observable context behavior.
Empirical comparison of extraction quality across agents is a Phase 3+ activity.
If you have data showing a different framing produces better graphs for a given
agent, file an issue with extraction comparisons attached.

_GRAPH_SCHEMA_DESCRIPTION = """\
Required JSON schema (graph schema version {schema_version}):

  capabilities: list of objects, each with:
    id (string): stable identifier, unique across all node collections in this response
    name (string): heading text or descriptive name of the capability
    description (string): first explanatory sentence from the section body, or empty string
    line (integer or null): body-relative line number (1-indexed from the first line after
      the closing ---; does not count frontmatter lines); null for synthesized nodes

  inputs: list of objects, each with:
    id (string): stable identifier, unique across all node collections in this response
    name (string): canonical name of the input
    kind (string): one of "file", "tool", "env", "context", "prerequisite"
    line (integer or null): body-relative line number, or null

  outputs: list of objects, each with:
    id (string): stable identifier, unique across all node collections in this response
    name (string): canonical name of the output
    kind (string): one of "file", "artifact", "side_effect", "return"
    line (integer or null): body-relative line number, or null

  edges: list of objects, each with:
    source_id (string): id of a capability in this response
    target_id (string): id of an input (for kind="requires") or an output (for kind="produces")
    kind (string): one of "requires", "produces"

Line numbering: line 1 is the first line of the skill body (the first line after
the closing ---). Frontmatter lines are not counted.

ID uniqueness: every id value must be unique across capabilities, inputs, and outputs
combined. tracemantle will reject the response if any id appears in more than one collection.

Edge integrity: source_id must reference a capability id; for kind="requires" the
target_id must reference an input id; for kind="produces" the target_id must reference
an output id. Dangling references will cause the response to be rejected.

The "requires" edge declares a capability's dependency on an item in the inputs
collection only. It cannot point at an output id. Capability-to-capability data
flow (capability B consuming capability A's output) is not modeled by edges in
this schema; describe such relationships in the capability description fields
instead. An edge with kind="requires" whose target_id is an output id is a
dangling reference and will cause the entire response to be rejected.

Empty lists are valid for any collection.\
