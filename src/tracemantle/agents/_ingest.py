"""Shared hardening helpers for ingested agent responses.

Critique and graph responses are untrusted input: an agent (or whatever fed
the agent) can put anything in the JSON. Two risks are handled here.

1. Terminal control characters. Ingested strings are printed into the
   human-readable report. A response carrying raw ANSI escapes (ESC, 0x1B)
   could forge output, e.g. a fake ``PASS`` line or a cleared screen.
   ``sanitize_ingested_text`` replaces each C0 control char, DEL, and C1
   control char with its visible backslash-escaped form so the content stays
   inert without being silently dropped.

The JSON output path is already safe: ``json.dumps`` escapes control
characters, so sanitization is applied only where text reaches the terminal.
