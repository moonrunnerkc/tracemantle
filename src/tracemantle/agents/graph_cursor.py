"""Cursor-specific graph-extraction prompt.

Framing basis: Cursor operates in an editor-integrated agent mode where the
effective context window available to a single tool call is meaningfully smaller
than a full API call. Cursor's documentation and community reports confirm that
shorter system instructions reliably fire while longer ones risk truncation or
lower instruction-following quality.

Differences from the Claude variant:
- No XML tags, no markdown headers.
- Single-paragraph task framing.
- Schema described as a compact pseudo-type signature instead of the full prose
  description (compact_graph_schema_signature).
- No worked example (the biggest single token reduction).
- One bare instruction line at the end.

Net effect: approximately 45% fewer characters vs the Claude variant for the
same skill body, attributable to schema description compression and example removal.
