"""Codex-specific graph-extraction prompt.

Framing basis: OpenAI prompt engineering guidance favors concise, direct system
prompts with minimal structural markup. Codex and GPT-4-class models in API
contexts respond well to markdown-style section headers and a single explicit
output instruction at the end. Verbose XML tagging adds token cost without
measurable accuracy improvement for these models.

Differences from the Claude variant:
- No XML tags. Section boundaries are markdown headers (### Schema, ### Skill).
- Full worked example included (same JSON as the claude variant; example fidelity
  matters more than token savings for Codex; cursor handles compression).
- Single "Output only the JSON object." line at the end instead of bracketing.
