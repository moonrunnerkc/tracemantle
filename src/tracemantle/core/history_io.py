"""Filesystem I/O for the validation history ledger.

Serialization, atomic writes, and load/append of ``.skillcheck-history.json``
live here, separated from the model, regression, and rendering logic in
``history.py``. ``history.py`` re-exports ``load_ledger``, ``save_ledger``, and
``append_run`` so ``from tracemantle.core.history import load_ledger`` still works.

The legacy save/append API remains single-writer compatibility code. New CLI
writes use immutable per-run records in history_store outside the bundle.
Ordinary reads never remove temporary files or migrate user data.

Module dependency rule: imports only from stdlib plus the ``history`` model and
the ``parser`` sibling module. No ``agents`` imports. No ``cli`` imports.
